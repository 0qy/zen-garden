2. Navigate to the `index.html` file and open your text editor.
3.  What you are going to find in this file has a whole lot of untidy code that is in need of a clean up.  Following the guidelines in [Formatting & Indenting Your HTML](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html), tidy up the code.
4.  Once you have finished tidying up the code, change the name of the file to `zen-garden-tidy.html`.

## Stage and push! 
Commit and push your changes to GitHub (push to your `zen-garden-tidy` branch, not to the `master` branch).

5. Create new pull request from your `zen-garden-tidy` branch to your `master` branch (hint: Navigate repo on GitHub website and create the pull request from there).  
6. Your pull request will be reviewed with your facilitator at your next 1:1. 


## Reflect 
Navigate to your `my-reflections-sprint-4` file and answer the questions under the `Code Readability Challenge` heading.

Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
